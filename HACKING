Requests for People HACKING on Newts                               -*- Text -*-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interested in developing for Newts? Write access is over SSH only, so you'll
need to arrange for an account on the development server. If you're interested,
get in touch with me at <tyler+newts@thoughtlocker.net>.

If you do work on Newts, I'd appreciate it if you kept the followings things in
mind.

1. Use the GNU code style, as described in the GNU Standards document.
   Exceptions:

   * Do not use U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT (`) for a 'left quote', as section 5.10
     suggests. Instead, use U+0027 APOSTROPHE (') to represent both quote
     marks in single-quoted text. For the rationale, see:
     <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html>

2. Comment your changes where appropriate.
3. Make your Subversion log entries informative and useful.
4. If you're working on something significant, as opposed to bugfixes or small
   changes, please let me know so that I can take your work into account while
   coming up with a release schedule.

Thanks!

- Tyler
