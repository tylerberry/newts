Requests for People HACKING on Newts                               -*- Text -*-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== General info for potential Newts hackers ==

The master Newts repository is hosted at <http://github.org/tylerberry/newts>.

If you code for Newts, I'd appreciate it if you kept the followings things in
mind.

1. Use the GNU code style, as described in the GNU Standards document.
   Exceptions:

   * Do not use U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT (`) for a 'left quote', as section 5.10
     suggests. Instead, use U+0027 APOSTROPHE (') to represent both quote
     marks in single-quoted text. For the rationale, see:
     <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html>

2. Comment your changes where appropriate.
3. Make your Git log entries informative and useful.
4. If you're working on something significant, as opposed to bugfixes or small
   changes, please let me know so that I can take your work into account while
   coming up with a release schedule.

== Using the bootstrap script ==

The bootstrap script will run GNU autotools to generate the configure script
and other necessary files. It requires the following to be installed and in
$PATH on your computer:

* GNU autoconf.
* GNU automake.
* GNU gettext.
* GNU libtool.

Finally, it requires a copy of the gnulib portability suite to be installed on
your computer. At the time of writing, gnulib is available via git at
<git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gnulib.git>.

The bootstrap script invokes gnulib-tool, which you need to place in
your $PATH. However, it must be run from the gnulib directory, which
means the easiest way to guarantee that it works correctly is to symlink
gnulib-tool to $HOME/bin and make sure $HOME/bin is in your $PATH.
