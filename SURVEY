SURVEY for people using Newts                                      -*- Text -*-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm interested in getting feedback from people downloading and using the Newts
software.  While Newts is free software and you're under no obligation to do
anything you don't want to, I'd appreciate if you'd share some information with
me that I can use to continue improving the system.

* Who are you?  Just personal curiosity :)

* What kind of system are you using Newts on?
 - Single-user? Multi-user? Just testing it out?
 - If you're using Newts as a bulletin board for your users, what kind of
   feedback have you received about the system?

* Have you found the admittedly incomplete documentation useful or helpful?
 - How about the in-program help?

* Did you use PLATO or a PLATO-derivative system?
 - How does Newts compare to PLATO Group Notes?
 - Are there any features from PLATO notes that are missing in Newts that you'd
   like to see in a future release?
 - Would you be interested in seeing varied modules for Newts in the spirit of
   the PLATO system?

* Did you use the UIUC Notesfiles software written by Essick and Kolstad?
 - How does Newts compare to UIUC Notesfiles?
 - Are there any features from UIUC Notesfiles that are missing in Newts that
   you'd like to see in a future release?

* Is there anything about the Newts user interface you'd like to see changed?
  (Keep in mind that an alternative client is in long-term development.)

* Is there anything about Newts that really annoys you?

* Are there any features or additions you'd like to see in the next release of
  Newts?

* Are you interested in participating in Newts development or testing?

Thanks for your feedback! - Tyler Berry, project maintainer
