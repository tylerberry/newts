* If the permissions of /var/spool/notes are wrong...

Things will crash pretty bad. An example is checknotes.

* If your clock's unset...

Newts will probably break, and break hard. I don't know why, and frankly I
don't really care that much. If your hardware clock thinks that the epoch
started twenty seconds ago you've got bigger problems than whether or not Newts
is working. Set your clock! (Footnote: my hardware clock does not persist over
restarts, and the not-workingness of notes tends to help remind me. So if this
gets fixed, somebody else is gonna hafta do it.)
