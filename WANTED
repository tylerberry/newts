These are things that I'd love to have done at some point, but they aren't
really high on my priority list. If you feel like writing and contributing one,
that would be wonderful.

* Feedback

These are things I just want information on.

** Feedback on the help screens.

How do the help screens work? Do they sit well with you? How can they be
improved?

** Feature requests and wish lists.

Are there any features you'd really like to see? General "wish-lists" are
welcome.

* Small Projects

These are small "afternoon" projects.

** An m4 macro to check whether particular users/groups exist on the system.

This should be smarter than just looking through /etc/passwd or /etc/group,
since (for example) systems with LDAP authentication might not have correct
info in those files. Checking for GNU id and using that might be a good start.

* Big Projects

These are major extensions to Newts. If you want to take on one of these, let
me know - I'll add you to AUTHORS and mark the project as assigned.

For all of these, you'll probably need to know about the backend/network API.
Talk to me if you want to know about this, because they don't technically exist
yet.

** Backends:

*** A MySQL backend.
*** A PostgreSQL backend.
*** An Oracle backend.
*** A Berkeley DB backend.
*** A gdbm backend, ndbm/dbm compatible if possible.
*** etc.

** Bindings:

*** Perl bindings.
*** PHP bindings.
*** Ruby bindings.

** Clients:

*** A Windows client.
*** A Web client.

Doing this in the Python bindings currently available is probably the best bet.
